package main

import (
	"github.com/urfave/cli"
)

var deleteCommand = cli.Command{
	Name:  "delete",
	Usage: "Delete any resources held by one or more containers",
	ArgsUsage: `<container-id> [container-id...]

   <container-id> is the name for the instance of the container.

EXAMPLE:
   If the container id is "ubuntu01" and ` + name + ` list currently shows the
   status of "ubuntu01" as "stopped" the following will delete resources held
   for "ubuntu01" removing "ubuntu01" from the ` + name + ` list of containers:

       # ` + name + ` delete ubuntu01`,
	Flags: []cli.Flag{
		cli.BoolFlag{
			Name:  "force, f",
			Usage: "Forcibly deletes the container if it is still running (uses SIGKILL)",
		},
	},
	Action: func(context *cli.Context) error {
		// TODO
		return nil
	},
}
